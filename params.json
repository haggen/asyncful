{"name":"Asyncful","body":"# Asyncful\r\n\r\nMake AJAX capable forms with ease.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nAsyncful does one thing and does it well. It works with `multipart` forms (for uploading files) and supports even IE6. Asyncful is lightweight and easy to use. Take a look.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    <form method=\"post\" action=\"/submit\"></form>\r\n\r\n    $('form').asyncful({ ... });\r\n\r\nOptions are plain AJAX jQuery settings, see the docs: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\r\n\r\nBut wait, you don't really have to set any options because Asyncful will use values set for `action` and `method` automagically. Also, it will assume that the response is a script and will evaluate it, so you don't have to worry with callbacks.\r\n\r\nJust one thing; if your form has `enctype` attribute set to `multipart/form-data` it will **NOT** use AJAX settings, since it will rely on the old trick of using an `<iframe>` to submit the data (for compatibility).","tagline":"jQuery plugin to make AJAX capable forms","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
